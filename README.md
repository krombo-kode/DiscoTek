# DiscoTek
A small app to read and rename audio files according to ID3 tag contents. 

Future hopeful features:
- making use of discogs API to add tag data to tracks that are missing it (possibly album art as well?)
- a UI of some sort
- a function to create a new library structure to store songs by artist/album
