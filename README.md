# DiscoTek
A small app to read and rename audio files according to ID3 tag contents. 

Recent Changes:
    - added functionality for subdirectory traversal
    - app now checks for an existing DiscoTek Library to write output files to, created directory if it doesn't exist
    - app now organizes files that have valid tag data into output library in sub-directories by Artist name.


Future hopeful features:
    - making use of discogs API (may use AudD and AudioDB instead) to add tag data to tracks that are missing it (possibly album art as well?)
    - a UI of some sort
    - a function to create a new library structure to store songs by artist/album *complete*
